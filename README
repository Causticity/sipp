Simple Image Processing Pipeline

What it says on the tin.

You will need to install go-fftw, by following the instructions on it's 
github page: https://github.com/runningwild/go-fftw. On Mac this is easy, on 
Windows not so much.

To build in a default Go workspace (as described in 
http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces), run 

go install github.com/Causticity/sipp/sipp from anywhere.

Windows version:
go install github.com\Causticity\sipp\sipp

This will build the sipp test program into the bin directory of the workspace.

Then to run it

sipp -in=<path to input image> -out=<prefix for output images> -a=true

For example, I have an out directory parallel to the standard src, pkg, and bin,
so I run from the root as follows:

sipp -in=src/github.com/Causticity/sipp/testdata/Lacryma_1024.png -out=out/Lac -a=true

This prepends the various output files with "Lac" and places them in the out
directory.

Each type of output file has it's own command-line argument, and there is an
argument to write all of them.

Full usage of sipp:
  -K int
    	Number of bins to scale the max radius to. The histogram will be 2K+1 bins on a side.
        This is used only for 16-bit images.
        If K is omitted, it is computed from the maximum excursion of the gradient.
        8-bit images always use a 511x511 histogram, as that covers the entire possible space.
  -a	Boolean; if true, write all the images
  -e	Boolean; if true, write a conventional entropy image
  -f	Boolean; if true, write the fft real and imaginary images
  -fls
    	Boolean; if true, write the fft log spectrum image
  -g	Boolean; if true, write the gradient real and imaginary images
  -ge
    	Boolean; if true, write a gradient-entropy image
  -h	Boolean; if true, write a histogram image
  -he
    	Boolean; if true, write a histogram-entropy image
  -hs
    	Boolean; if true, write a histogram image with the center spike suppressed
  -in string
    	Input image file; must be grayscale png
  -out string
    	Output image file prefix
  -t	Boolean; if true, write a thumbnail image
