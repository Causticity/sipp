Simple Image Processing Pipeline

What it says on the tin.

To build in a default Go workspace (as described in 
http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces), run 

go install github.com/Causticity/sipp/sipp from anywhere.

You will also need to install go-fftw, by following the instruction on it's 
github page: https://github.com/runningwild/go-fftw

Windows version:
go install github.com\Causticity\sipp\sipp

This will build sipp into the bin directory of the workspace.

Then to run it

sipp -in=<path to input image> -out=<prefix for output images>

For example, I have an out directory parallel to the standard src, pkg, and bin,
so I run from the root as follows:

sipp -in=src/github.com/Causticity/sipp/testdata/Lacryma_1024.png -out=out/Lac

This prepends the various output files with "Lac" and places them in the out
directory.
